## Usage

### HTML Structure

The accordion is structured with a series of `.accordion-item` elements. Each item contains a header (`.accordion-header`) and corresponding content (`.accordion-content`).

```html
<div class="accordion">
    <div class="accordion-item">
        <div class="accordion-header">Section 1</div>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>Your content goes here...</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <!-- Add more accordion items as needed -->
</div>
